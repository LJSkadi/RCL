# Open React Component Library

Although still behind Angular in the sheer numbers of usage, React is leading in popularity in Stack overflowâ€™s 2017 most loved component libraries. 
One of the great advantages of react is its components. Due to its modular design a plethora of component libraries has been created to help kickstart your work with components. However, no comprehensive library of all existing libraries exist. This was the foundation of my idea to build a library, where developers can search and find as well as contribute their ideas to the community, because there are more important challenges than inventing a solution twice.

### Functionality

You can add your own components. If your component is already a deployed NPM package, you can use the easy add option by getting all information through the package's name from the NPM API.

You can search through the component library by using the search by title or keywords and add interesting components as bookmarks.

#### Structure

The front-end is stored in the ```client``` folder and the back-end in the ```server``` folder. Both are connected through the ```api.js```, which is included in the ```client``` folder. You can run the app locally by using the commands 

```npm run dev:client``` and ```npm run dev:server```. 

Please start the server first. For any additional questions, feel free to ask  :octocat:
